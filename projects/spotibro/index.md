[Spoibro](https://spotibro.com) is a webapp which allows Spotify users to collobrate in realtime on a playlist. Some key points that I strived for in the development of this app is
- No account necessary other than your Spotify account.
- Music is sync with all those that are listening with you
- Realtime collobrate playlists

**Origin**
Spotibro was born from an annoyance that I couldn't listen to a song in sync with my coworker easily. It would consist of many slack messages trying to start the song at the same time on our respective Spotify apps. At this time, I was wanting to make a full stack app in .NET to show how much I had learned by finishing an internship and working fulltime for half a year at a software company. Spotibro was born.

**Process**
I wanted to develop Spotibro as close as I could to any business idea. That means
1. Come up with the business rules and how the app will operate
2. Whiteboard the basic functionality
3. Design the user flow
4. Start coding
