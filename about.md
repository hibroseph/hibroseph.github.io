Hello, my name is Joseph Ridgley and I am currently a Software Engineer I at [Cambia Health Solutions](https://www.cambiahealth.com/). 

I started coding professionally in mid 2019 and have worked mostly in the .NET ecosystem. 

I previously worked for [LabStats](https://labstats.com) for 2 years as a Junior Software Engineer. There I worked with 3 - 6 other developers to maintain our SAAS product. In our product, we had a wide range of apps from multiple customer facing webapps, mobile app, internal webapps, and background processes that we maintained. With such a small team, I was able to touch all parts of our stack including feature development, bug fixing, production support, outage resolution, mentor for multiple interns, project lead, infrastructure management, and network management.

I am eager to advance my career and learn as much as I can.
