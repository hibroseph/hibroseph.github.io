Hi, my name is Joseph Ridgley and I love programming. I started seriously programming in college when I started studying computer science. When I got to college, I knew that I wanted to work in tech but I didn't know what part of tech. After conversations with professors & students, I ended up studying computer engineering. I wanted to get as much breath in technology as I could and computer engineering seemed like the best option for that. About halfway through course workload, I knew I wanted to do software as my career choice and not electrical engineering. I felt much more capable programming than I did doing electrical circuit analysis. I loved electrical engineering for the breath but didn't feel comfident competing for it in the workforce. I didn't know what type of software I wanted to do most. In my course workload, we did a lot of lower level programming such as; C, C++, and some HDLs (Verilog, System Verilog). 

I got my first internship at a company called LabStats. LabStats has a SASS product which is created towards lab techs (computer lab) and helping them with their job. It was a Microsoft shop and as such, I got very familiar with .NET creating a test environment automation platform. Towards the end of my internship, I got a job offer and decided to stay on with them full time.
