### A lesson I have yet to learn.

TLDR; Test your code as you write it unless you are willing to bet your life that it will work correctly or it is extremely trival

 Let me set the scenario for you, I want to write some code and get it done quick (you know to provide that value). I sit down and write some tests for the high level objective, whether that is a path finding algorithm, a module, or some library code. I then code like a madman for 2 to 3 hours until I can try to run my high level tests to see if my code works. I run my high level tests and **NOTHING WORKS**. I then spend 2 to 3 hours testing the smaller pieces of code to see what is going on.
